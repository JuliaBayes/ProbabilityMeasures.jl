# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog],
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning].

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `AbstractProbabilityMeasure{F,S}` and the normalized-only measure interface:
  `logdensityof`, `rand`, `support`, `insupport`, `params`, `checkparams`, and the
  moment/distribution-function surface.
- The `RealLine`, `NonNegativeReals` and `RealInterval` supports. `PositiveReals`
  and `UnitInterval` will arrive with the first measure that needs one.
- `Normal(μ, σ)`, `Exponential(θ)` and `Uniform(a, b)`, with heterogeneous
  parameter types and no promotion or validation at construction.
- `libs/ProbabilityMeasuresTest`: a reusable conformance suite (`test_measure`)
  covering interface conformance, totality, type genericity, type stability,
  zero allocations, normalization, cdf/quantile, moments, four AD backends, and
  GPU-shaped broadcast.
- ForwardDiff package extension, so reparameterized sampling is differentiable.

### Notes

- The exported surface is intentionally minimal: every name is one a PPL is
  expected to call. `mode`, `skewness`, `kurtosis`, `mgf`, `cf`, `Matrixvariate`,
  `variateform`/`valuesupport`, and the unused supports are omitted rather than
  shipped speculatively, since adding an export later is non-breaking and removing
  one is not.
